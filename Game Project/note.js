 allows JS to access HTML elements and styles to manipulate them

 DOM is simply a connection point btw HTML documents and JS codes,
 IT is automatically created by the browser on load.
 Each HTML element is one object.
 Document is a special object in JS and it serves as an entry-point into the DOM
 THE DOM is not part  of JS but part of the WEB APIS,
 WEB APIS are libraries that JS can interact with
